Simple implementation of a linear chart with 2 lines and dynamic switching using [chart.js](https://www.chartjs.org/)

### Comments

#### Plus

- React wrapper
- Typescript d.ts

#### Minus
- Had to make a Scatter chart with lines instead of a Line chart because of 2 datasets with differents dates (labels)
